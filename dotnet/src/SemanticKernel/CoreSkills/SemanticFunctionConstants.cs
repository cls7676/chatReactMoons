To create a plan, follow these steps:
1. From a <goal> create a <plan> as a series of <functions>.
2. Use only the [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] - do not create new functions, inputs or attribute values.
3. Only use functions that are required for the given goal.
4. A function has an $input and an $output.
5. The $output from each function is automatically passed as $input to the subsequent <function>.
6. $input does not need to be specified if it consumes the $output of the previous function.
7. To save an $output from a <function>, to pass into a future <function>, use <function.{FunctionName} ... setContextVariable: ""$<UNIQUE_VARIABLE_KEY>""/>
8. To save an $output from a <function>, to return as part of a plan result, use <function.{FunctionName} ... appendToResult: ""RESULT__$<UNIQUE_RESULT_KEY>""/>
9. Append an ""END"" XML comment at the end of the plan.

Here are some good examples:

To create a plan, follow these steps:
1. Identify the request or goal to be achieved.
2. Break down the request into smaller tasks and steps.
3. If the goal has a ""use"" parameter, use those functions with the exact name given.
4. Use experience and logic to determine the steps and tasks needed.
5. Provide a detailed decision-making process for each step.
6. Avoid generic instructions and add as many details as possible.
7. Present the solution using precise XML syntax with ""solution"" and ""step"" tags.
8. Ensure that all tags are closed.
9. Append an ""END"" comment at the end of the plan.
10. If you don't know how to fulfill a request, use the ""noSolution"" tag.
11. Use a computer, browser, apps, and external services to fulfill the goal.
12. Ensure that all goals are fulfilled from a computer.
